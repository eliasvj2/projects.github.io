    <p>
      <b>Iceland</b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice
      co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A
      country where insular existence had spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

        <p>
          When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special
          attention to the country's namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles
          of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and
          takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull
          glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered
          from Reykjavik (and Skaftfell).

          The <b> Aurora Borealis</b> takes its name from the Roman goddes of dawn,
          Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreaux. From september
          to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lighthow.
        </p>
        <p class="box2-p">
          The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northen Lights
          is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun
          interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic filed. This
          releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the
          skies.
